In mcximages and mmclimages two folders
build_image.sh and Dockerfile are used to create image which contains binary
run_container.sh is used to run a container of the image 
To run mmcl container, rocm-dkms is required and a GPU support ROCm platform
To run mcx container, you have to make sure Nvidia driver and Docker 19.03 have been installed. CUDA toolkit is not required. Another toolkit is required on thehost: nvidia-container-toolkit
Instructions of the installation of this toolkit is on https://github.com/NVIDIA/nvidia-docker

Once the mcximage/mmclimage is created, the following commands are used to run mcx/mmcl
./run_conatiner.sh <param1> <param2> ...
example:
./run_container.sh -A -f benchmark1.json -b 0
./run_container.sh -f cube2.inp -s cube2 -n 1e8 -b 0 -D TP -M G -F bin
The input files store in the current folder where you store run_container.sh and the output files will be in this folder also
